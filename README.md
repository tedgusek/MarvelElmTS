Displaying Marvel characters via Marvel API in an Elm app with TS backend

The backend is working, You need to sign up at: https://developer.marvel.com/ This is where you can get your own Secret API Key and Public Key. Create your own Env file in the rott directory, and assign your keys to the variables: MARVEL_API_KEY_PUBLIC MARVEL_API_KEY_PRIVATE You can use Postman to check the calls for yourself

The Frontend using Elm is still a work in progress, currently running into compiling issues that need some further debugging.
