Displaying Marvel characters via Marvel API in an Elm app with TS backend


In order to use this App:

• Fork this repository and then clone it to your local machine

• Sign up at: https://developer.marvel.com/
• This is where you can get your own Secret API Key and Public Key.

•Create your own Env file in the root directory, and assign your keys obtained above to the variables: MARVEL_API_KEY_PUBLIC MARVEL_API_KEY_PRIVATE

• npm run dev

Currently need to work on the styling, and confirming if I was limited on the API call to a certain amount of characters, or if that is the amount of characters that they supply

Some Stretch Features imclude implementing the OpenAiAPI to allow the users to chose different characters who they would want to see spar, and get the speculative results of how such a fight would turn out. Also want ot implement GraphQL to allow the users to fetch only certain characters etc. perhaps grab more data from the Marvel API...

If you grab this code and expand on it, please let me know, I'd love to see what you come up with!!
